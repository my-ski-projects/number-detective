## What’s the game?

It’s a magical game where I will find any secret number that you think between 1 and 15 !!

## How to Play?

1. _Pick a Secret Number:_ You need to pick a secret number between 1 and 15, but don’t tell me what it is ! You may write it in a slip of paper
2. _Answer Yes or No:_ I will show you four Cards, you just need to tell me If your secret number is present in the Card or not, by saying ‘yes’ or ‘no’

## What’s the maths magic?

The magic is in the numbers on the cards! They’re arranged in a special way based on ‘binary numbers’. Binary numbers are a fancy way of saying ‘numbers in ones and zeros. This makes it really quick to find the secret number !
Each card in the game represents a place(bit) in the binary number (from right to left): Card 1 for the 1’s place, Card 2 for the 2’s place, Card 3 for the 4’s place, and Card 4 for the 8’s place. If a number has a ‘1’ in that place, it will appear on that card. So, by asking you which card the number appears on, I am actually figuring out the binary representation of your secret number!

## Why is this cool?

This game is not just fun, it’s also a great way to learn about binary numbers and how they work. 🎈
